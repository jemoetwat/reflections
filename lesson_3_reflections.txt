When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  ...

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	So you have full control and your changes are not replaced unwanted by changes made by others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	fork: when you want to work on files separatly from the original
	clone: when you want to colaborate with others
	branch: when you want to explore new features or separate versions
